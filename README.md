<!-- # Intro -->
<!-- * Vim "grammar" (commands are self-documenting) -->
<!-- * Modes: visual, insert, command. -->

<!-- ## Why hate Vim? -->
<!-- * counterintuitive -->
<!-- * immediacy of typing - nothing happens, then gibberish -->
<!-- * does not seem to respond -->
<!-- * learning wall -->

<!-- ## Why learn Vim? -->
<!-- * you dislike the mouse -->
<!-- * context switch -->
<!-- * different mindset -->
<!-- * commands will just "work" elsewhere -->
<!-- * it sneakily opens -->

Moving fast: at least Ctrl h will work in almost every software and the command line.
