## Basic text searching
```
f // find
; // next
, // previous
```

Search forwards:
```
/<word>
n // next
N // previous
```

Search backwards:
```
?<word>
```

You can use // or ?? to repeat the search, or simply cycle through the history with arrow up and down.

Quick search, while on top of a word:
* // next
# previous

Fuzzy matching is supported:
```
g#
g*
```
